INSTALLATION
======================================================================

PREREQUISITES:
==============

I have the following versions installed on my system at the moment and
the code compiles and works. If you have older versions it might
work. To check, edit configure.ac in the main directory and change the
numbers in the "PKG_CHECK_MODULES" lines to the versions of the
libraries that you have. If everything works, send me an email and
I'll change the requirements.

   - cairo: version 1.9.2 (http://cairographics.org)
   - poppler: version 0.12.2 (http://poppler.freedesktop.org)
   - glib: version 2.22 (part of the GTK project: http://www.gtk.org/)

You also need the following libraries:

   - libjpeg (http://www.ijg.org/)
   - libpaper (http://packages.qa.debian.org/libp/libpaper.html)
   - popt (http://rpm5.org/)


BUILDING IT:
============

Now run

  autoreconf

in the main project directory to create the configure and Makefile.in
files. Run

  ./configure

or

  ./configure --prefix=<somewhere>

to create the Makefiles needed. Finally, run

  make

and

  make install
